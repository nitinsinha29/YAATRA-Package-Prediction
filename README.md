# YAATRA-Package-Prediction
Predicting Yaatra Package Suitability: A Data-Driven Approach-

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify individuals who are likely to be interested in purchasing Yaatra travel packages. Through comprehensive data cleansing and insightful visualizations, we aim to uncover key patterns and relationships within the data to inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

Data Cleansing and Preparation:

Data Collection: Gathered the data from kaggle 
Data Cleaning: Address issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
Data Transformation: Transform raw data into a suitable format for analysis, such as creating new features, scaling variables, and encoding categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:

Descriptive Statistics: Summarize key characteristics of the data, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.
Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, bar charts) to explore relationships between variables and identify potential patterns.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on their demographics, travel preferences, and spending habits to understand their unique needs and preferences.

Predictive Modeling:

Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that have the strongest impact on the likelihood of purchasing a Yaatra package.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) based on the data characteristics and the desired level of model interpretability.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model on the cleaned and prepared data, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Optimization: Fine-tune model parameters to improve its predictive accuracy and generalization ability.

Results and Insights:

Identify Key Predictors: Determine the most important factors that influence the likelihood of purchasing a Yaatra package.
Develop Customer Profiles: Create detailed profiles of ideal customers based on their characteristics and preferences.
Generate Actionable Insights: Translate the model's findings into actionable recommendations for marketing and product development strategies.

Visualizations:

Customer Segmentation: Visualize customer segments using clustering techniques or other dimensionality reduction methods.
Feature Importance: Visualize the importance of different features in predicting package suitability using techniques like feature importance plots.
Model Performance: Visualize the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrices, ROC curves, and lift charts.

How to execute : 
First downlaod and save it in any folder 
Open CMD with the same file location
type-- python app.py ( you must have installed numpy , pandas , flask and Scikit-learn)
Then you have an http://126.0.0.1 (may be differ) click on it
