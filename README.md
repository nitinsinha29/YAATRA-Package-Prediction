# YAATRA-Package-Prediction
Predicting Yaatra Package Suitability: A Data-Driven Approach-

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify individuals who are likely to be interested in purchasing Yaatra travel packages. Through comprehensive data cleansing and insightful visualizations, we aim to uncover key patterns and relationships within the data to inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

Project Goals:
Develop a model to predict user interest in Yaatra travel packages.
Enhance customer satisfaction through targeted marketing.

Data Analysis Steps:
Data Collection: The data is retrieved from Kaggle.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
Data Transformation: Prepares data for analysis (feature creation, scaling, encoding).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:
Summarizes data using descriptive statistics.
Creates visualizations to explore relationships and patterns.
Segments customers based on demographics, preferences, and spending habits.

Predictive Modeling:
Selects relevant features for prediction.
Chooses a machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression).
Trains and evaluates the model on the prepared data.
Optimizes the model for better performance.

Results and Insights:
Identifies key factors influencing package purchase likelihood.
Develops customer profiles based on characteristics and preferences.
Generates actionable recommendations for marketing and product development.

Visualizations:
Visualizes customer segments using clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Shows feature importance in predicting package suitability.
Visualizes model performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and lift charts.

Execution Steps (Assuming a Flask application):
Download and save the project files (app.py and potentially others).
Open a command prompt (CMD) and navigate to the directory containing the files.
Install required libraries (numpy, pandas, Flask, scikit-learn) using pip install numpy pandas Flask scikit-learn.
Run the application using python app.py.
Access the application at the provided URL ([invalid URL removed]:port_number, the port might differ).
Fill in the details and view the model's prediction.

Potential Improvements:
Data Exploration: Consider including feature engineering to create new informative features from existing ones.
Model Selection: Explore different machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) and compare their performance.
Model Explainability: If using complex models, incorporate techniques like LIME or SHAP to explain model predictions and gain insights into customer behavior.
Deployment: Consider deploying the model as a web service for wider accessibility and integration with Yaatra's booking platform.
